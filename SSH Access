Windows 10 and all later versions have a built-in feature that allows you to connect to a Linux machine directly using the Command Prompt (CMD).
If you’re using an older version of Windows (before Windows 10), you’ll need to use PuTTY to connect to your Linux machine.
Connect via CMD: ssh ip 
        Example: ssh 192.168.0.110
Connect via PuTTY: Install PuTTY software, then enter the IP address of your Linux machine in the Host Name (or IP address) field. 
                  On the right side, make sure the Port is set to 22 (default for SSH). Finally, click Open to start the connection.
