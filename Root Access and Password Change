Root Access: There are three types of root in a Linux system:
            a. Root account (most powerful account)
            b. Root directory (/)
            c. Root home directory (/root)

Switch to root: su -
Switch root directory: cd /
Switch home directory: cd /root

Change root password: sudo passwd root
Change password for user: passwd
